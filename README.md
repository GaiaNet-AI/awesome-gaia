## About Gaia
Gaia allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your hardware with the flexibility of using an OpenAI-compatible API. It’s an open-source solution for those looking to have more control over their AI infrastructure while enjoying the same API integrations widely used by OpenAI models.

For more information, check out the official [Gaia documentation](https://docs.gaianet.ai/?ref=awesome-gaia).
